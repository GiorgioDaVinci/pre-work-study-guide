# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide webpage is a place where all the notes that will be taken during the bootcamp will be stored.

It enables me to refer back to my notes at a later date  during the bootcamp.

I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
